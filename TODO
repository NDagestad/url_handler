Goals for beta release
	* Add exclusion conditions
	* Make it configurable what conditions make a URI match
		* Have a logical clause evalutaed e.g.: 
			(ext && scheme) || (mime && !scheme) || url
			* Where !name would be not matching the exclusion condition for that name ?
		* Reduce the logical clause to it's simplest form ? Might be hard
		* Notify the user if they defined a condition but it has no effet in the
			clause (will need the previous point to be doable)
		*  Maybe do this in a filter; another language might handle the
			problem better
	
	* Make exec parametrized e.g.: %u for the URI to handle, and maybe more %s
		for the section, %p for the scheme (protocol), %e extension etc
	
	* Add mltiple loglevels

BUG:
	* Segfault when handling the output of `ls ld --hyperlink=always d`
		* There is no way for the program to handle it correctly, but it should fail gracefully
