Goals for next release
	* Add exclusion conditions
	* Make it configurable what conditions make a URI match                       PARTIALY DONE
		* Make !name match the exclusion condition for that name ?
		* Reduce the logical clause to it's simplest form ?                       Might be hard
		* Notify the user if they defined a condition but it has no effet in the
			clause (will need the previous point to be doable)
	* Add lazy evaluation of the match_expression clauses
		* This will probably need a patch to gVal
	
	

Goals for later:
	* Make exec parametrized e.g.: %u for the URI to handle, and maybe more %s
		for the section, %p for the scheme (protocol), %e extension etc
		- Is there even a use for this? 
			+ Yes if the command needs the url at a specific position
			+ To use shell pipelines as the exec
	* Open a file to the right line when it has the format PATH:lineno
	* Make MatchExpression a shadowable parameter?

BUG:
	* Segfault when handling the output of `ls -ld --hyperlink=always .`
		* There is no way for the program to handle it correctly, but it should fail gracefully
		* Also happens when there are tabs in the data ?
		* Investigate to really understand why this kind of input crashes the hanlder
			* Somehow I must detect if the data is something I can hanlde or not probably
	* If a path contains a non-existant directory, get_mime_type will segfault
