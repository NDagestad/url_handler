Goals for v1 release
	* Add exclusion conditions
	* Make it configurable what conditions make a URI match
		* Make !name match the exclusion condition for that name ?
		* Reduce the logical clause to it's simplest form ? Might be hard
		* Notify the user if they defined a condition but it has no effet in the
			clause (will need the previous point to be doable)
	
	* Make exec parametrized e.g.: %u for the URI to handle, and maybe more %s
		for the section, %p for the scheme (protocol), %e extension etc
	
	* Add multiple loglevels

	* Make MatchExpression a shadowable parameter?

Goals for later:
	* Make it possible to handle non URIs - this is almost possible already, I just can't use http
	  as a protocol when it is missing without checking if there already is a handler for the string
		* Get closer to plan 9's plumber by handling arbitrary strings
			e.g. 
				- CVE-... opens the corresponding CVE in the browser
				- something(X) opens a man page X for something
				- RFC XXXX opens the rfc in the browser
	* Open a file to the right line when it has the format PATH:lineno

BUG:
	* Segfault when handling the output of `ls -ld --hyperlink=always .`
		* There is no way for the program to handle it correctly, but it should fail gracefully
	* segfault for this example: `url_handler "CVE 2018-16422"`
		* might be the same bug as above but there is no reason for it this time
		-> cause is in url parsing in url.go:39
