Goals for v1 release
	* Add exclusion conditions
	* Make it configurable what conditions make a URI match
		* Make !name match the exclusion condition for that name ?
		* Reduce the logical clause to it's simplest form ? Might be hard
		* Notify the user if they defined a condition but it has no effet in the
			clause (will need the previous point to be doable)
	
	* Make exec parametrized e.g.: %u for the URI to handle, and maybe more %s
		for the section, %p for the scheme (protocol), %e extension etc
	
	* Add multiple loglevels

	* Make MatchExpression a shadowable parameter?

BUG:
	* Segfault when handling the output of `ls -ld --hyperlink=always .`
		* There is no way for the program to handle it correctly, but it should fail gracefully
